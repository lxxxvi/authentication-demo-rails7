# authentication-demo-rails7

An application that demoes how to implement various authentication mechanisms in Ruby.

Namely the kind of stuff you might otherwise use the [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem for. In particular it does:

* User signup
* User log in, log out
* Email address confirmation
* Password reset via email (forgotten password)

This application is not meant to look pretty or be useful in any other way than what's stated above.

## Usage

It's just a plain old Rails app, so set it up like that. ;)
